[To improve the model:] \
Discard rate, add discard information to add complexity to the model \
Check bins for lengths, maybe use 5 cm….need to check the length measurement error for the different data set …ask Malo or Peter W. It should be base in the wors fleet structure \
Can we justify a time varying selectivity or time varying catchability Time block for cpue \
Check recruitment autocorrelation like sensitibity \
Which selex can be better to use age or length? Can we use both in the same model? \
Check the equilibrium, and fishing before 1972…check differences mfcl and SS3 \
Check more plausible movement, can fish move from region 1 to 6? questions like that \
Check selex some of the LL can be logistic \
Try to estimate M and h and check the values \
Downweigh the bad index like a sensitibity \
Check max age, extend age until 8-10yrs (32-40quarters) (done)... improve the estimation of M and Lmax \
Delete sample size lower than 100 \
